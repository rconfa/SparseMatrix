Project's specifications are taken from the 2020 C++ exam of the course "Programming C++" and can be found in the file assignment.pdf in italian languages.

A sparse matrix is a matrix in which only the elements explicitly inserted are physically stored.
I use a ordered linked-list to represent the sparse matrix efficiently. Each new element is inserted in order according to its coordinates.

File main.cpp: contains examples of class use. I used this file as a test file for the class.
